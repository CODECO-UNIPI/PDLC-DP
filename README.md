# PDLC-DP
This repo includes the data pre-processing functionality prior to the PDLC Deep Learning Operations.  


## Status:
&#9745; ICOM's operations 

&#9745; i2CAT's operations

&#9744; FOR operations 


<u>To be discussed:</u>

1. Need to define the communication aspects (recommendation: using REST API), 
2. Need to discuss the pod's privileges (RBAC to take the node's and pods' info  and send them to i2cat's model)
3. Anything else that may occur

Notes:

- Paths inside the files must be changed
- Python version to be used: 3.9
